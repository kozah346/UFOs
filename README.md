## Overview of the Analysis

The webpage and dynamic table created in this analysis are working as intended. However, a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings is provided that will allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. After filtering the date, users are now able to filter for the city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results

### Filtering by date

## Summary

From the above analysis, the following is noted:

  * One drawback of this webpage is that it contains data limited to mainly North America particularly United States and Canada. This can show some sense of bias hence it needs to include data from various parts of the world. 
  * The above drawback can be fixed by having a web scraping functionality that can pull data from a source that updates regularly hence including up to date information. 
  * Creating a functionality that is flexible in the sense that, for example, if a user is searching for UFO sightings from the city named "benton", they can obtain the results by having the name "ben", something that cannot be executed by this webpage as it will turn out blank.
